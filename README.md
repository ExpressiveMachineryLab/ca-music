# Collaborative development repository for table top CA Music prototype.

This repository is a collection of prototypes made for a multidisciplinary research project at Expressive Machinery Lab, Georgia Tech. The project focuses on engaging kids in elementary and middle school on tabletop interactive surfaces in a museum.

The music application is a prototype of using Cellular Automata, music and visuals to engage concepts of computational thinking in a 5 minute experience.

# Dependencies Overview

- Max 8
- P5.js
- Sonic Pi (for 1 protoype)
- Tone.js

* `Max 8`
* `tone.js`
* `Sonic Pi`
* `p5.js`

## <a name="folder_contents">Folder Contents</a>
This folder contains multiple prototypes in their own sub folder

* `1d-CA` is a 1-Dimensional drum step sequencer using classic Neighbor rules of CA, built in Max 8.
* `p5` is a 2-Dimensional melodic step sequencer built entirely on tone.js and p5.js to be run as a browser web application
* `SonicPISequencer` is a 2-Dimensional melodic step sequencer built in p5 and Sonic Pi (early iteration of `p5` )
* `max-prototype` is an experimental 2-D CA that generates beats and melodies using force directed graph-like computation. Inspired from the popular music application `nodebeat`
